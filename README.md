# Personal Portfolio Website Code
## Programmed by Benjamin Greenberg
Mini Project for Coding Temple

___
## Project Overview
This project uses my understanding of Hypertext Markup Language \(HTML\) to create a personal portfolio webpage. My webpage is easily navigated via a navigation bar found in the header of all 5 pages. I have webpages dedicated to a homepage, about me, contact, projects, and skills. Throughout these pages I implement anchor tags for outside links, figures for imaging and captions, and use code to embed outside webpages. In the skills section I include an html table. Each page has a head section configured with appropriate metacharacters, and uses semantic tag formatting to improve Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\).
