        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I graduated from Cornell University in 2016 with a Bachelors of Science degree in Hotel Administration, and upon graduation spent a year with the Cleveland Browns scouting department.
            I utilized my degree as a Walt Disney World Cast Member making magic for guests staying at the Wilderness Lodge Hotel. After my time with the Walt Disney Company ended, I moved back to New York where I started coaching High School Football and working with a sports and education focused non-profit organization.
            Most recently I worked with Victory Lap in Business Development providing sales support for SaaS start ups. All of these experiences led me to realize that the most valuable tool a professional can have is technical knowledge and sparked my curiosity in programming.
            With this new found direction I decided to enroll in Coding Temple's Software Development program where I am currently studying in their bootcamp program. I hope to join a great tech organization and continue my path as a lifelong learner by furthering my programming skills as a Software Engineer or potentially as a Product Manager.
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time I like to play piano, watch new and classic films, eat at new restaurants and travel with my wife, and explore Central Florida's local theme parks, attractions, and beaches.
